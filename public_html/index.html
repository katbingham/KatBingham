        <p>Kathryn Bingham grew up in the beautiful state of Utah and draws incredible energy from the unparalleled
            beauty
            found here. In University, Kathryn was curious about several subjects and struggled to choose only one to
            pursue. After time spent exploring Business, Italian, and Medicine, Kat landed in a major study of
            Mechanical
            Engineering and minor of Visual Arts. She found these two disciplines provide a breadth and balance of
            subject
            matter she is both excited about and excels in.</p>

        <p>During University, Kat's favorite courses included: Italian, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Yoga,
            Painting Fundamentals, Dynamic System Modeling, Neuromechanics of Human Movement, and Fundamentals of
            Electrical
            Engineering.</p>

        <p>Since University, Kathryn has worked in the Medical Device Industry in the greater Salt Lake City area. She
            currently works in R&D Software and Firmware Automated Test Development.</p>

        <p>Kathryn finds herself most at home creating things. Whether that is a <em>new product, website</em>,
            <em>piece of
                art</em>, or <em>culinary masterpiece</em>, she is there for the process and the ride it brings. Kat is
            always down for a good long discussion of <em>music and art</em> and everything it touches, and feels her
            <em>playlist</em> game is ridiculously sharp.</p>

        <p>Above all, Kathryn is a student in life and brings her curiosity into everything she touches.</br>
            She would definitely like to learn more about you. Slide into her <em>DM's</em> to suggest a collaboration,
            ask
            a question, commission work or simply connect.</p>
